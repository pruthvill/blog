    -not your own
    -if you want to fail fail at the things you want to and choose your problems
    -try to find your own desires
    -explore a lot(inbuilt or found)
    -chinese curse may you get what you want
     

      Humans reproduce two ways ,biologically using genes and culturally using memes(darwininan).
        In biological reproduction we dont have the choice of what genes we want.You can't choose your gender ,color of your skin and other things
      that are passed on through genes and genes can only be passed on from parent to offspring.Evolution happens very slowly.Humans have not a had a major change in genes for past 10000 years.
      We diverted from chimps around 6 million years ago and we still share our 98.8%  of DNA with them.
      Memes are passed on through culture and it can passed on from one individual to another.Memes can chnage drastically even in one generation and we have the choice to accept the memes or discard them.
      The first and primary source for the memes in our life is mostly famlily.As we grow older we acquire more sources of memes and they effect us directly or indirectly.
      Even though we have the choice to choose what memes to accept or discard most of us just go on with the memes that are passed on to us from the society.

      As We grow up society's functioning are passed on through us sub-consciously.

      If you obeserve your day to day actions most if not all of your actions are the result of the memes from society.
      The World will ask you who you are and if you dont know the world will tell you.

      If you dont have desires of your own the societies desires will become your desires.

      How to find what you truly desire.
      You cant want to hang out with dinosuars that sounds impossible but who knows.

      People like to think they are talking about ideas but most times they are just talking abbout fashion.

      You cant compete with someone who is having fun.
      Thinking for yourself.

      Insight based and Iteration based.

      Rene Girard's theory of Mimetic desire (born with no
      preferences) is one of the most fascinating theories I have ever
      come across. It suggests that most, if not all, of our desires
      do not come from ourselves but from others and the situations we
      are in.

      Over the past 1-1.5 years, I have seen a massive change in how I
      view life and what I want from it because of that theory. I
      remember when I was a child, all I wanted to do when I grew up
      was buy all the DVDs of the cartoons that I used to like and
      watch them for the rest of my life. I wanted to read all the
      books I could find, and I would even finish most of them in one
      sitting. I wanted to become a scientist and spend all my time
      working with robots and researching about immortality. The
      12-year-old me was so ambitious and optimistic. If he could see
      me somehow, he would despise what I have become.

      But I have realized that our desires do not stay the same over
      time. I think it's easy to forget that we are not the same
      people we were 5 years ago; we are not even the same people we
      were a year ago. As we grow older and become more logical, the
      world just starts becoming less magical. (Or maybe all of this
      is just coping to console the 12-year-old me).

      People think that they will work hard in their 20s, make a lot
      of money, and then retire in their 30s and then pursue their
      passions, move into a calm place, and just chill for the rest of
      their lives. But when the time comes, even if they have made
      enough money, they realize that they don't want to do it now,
      maybe because they have grown past that desire and now they want
      to pursue something else, or they have some kind of
      responsibilities like family or their professional career.

      So, do what you want to do now because then you won't want to.
      It's okay to have wants that others don't understand.
