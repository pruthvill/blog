              The World will ask you who you are and if you dont know the world will tell you.

              Humans reproduce two ways ,Biologically using genes and culturally using memes(darwininan meme not the social media one).
              In biological reproduction we dont have the choice what genes we want.You can't choose your gender ,color of your skin other things
              that are passed on through genes and genes can only be passed on from parent to offspring.Humans have not a had a major change in genes for past 10000 years.
              We diverted from chimps around 6 million years ago and we still share our 98.8%  of DNA with them.
              Memes are passed on through culture and it can passed on from one individual to another.Memes can chnage drastically even in one generation Unlike genes here we have the choice to accept the memes or discard them.
              



              If you dont have desires of your own the societies desires will become your desires.

              How do we funcition day to day
              Memes 
              Genes 


              People like to think they are talking about ideas but most times they are just talking abbout fashion.

              Insight based and Iteration based.

                Rene Girard's theory of Mimetic desire (born with no
                preferences) is one of the most fascinating theories I have ever
                come across. It suggests that most, if not all, of our desires
                do not come from ourselves but from others and the situations we
                are in.

                Over the past 1-1.5 years, I have seen a massive change in how I
                view life and what I want from it because of that theory. I
                remember when I was a child, all I wanted to do when I grew up
                was buy all the DVDs of the cartoons that I used to like and
                watch them for the rest of my life. I wanted to read all the
                books I could find, and I would even finish most of them in one
                sitting. I wanted to become a scientist and spend all my time
                working with robots and researching about immortality. The
                12-year-old me was so ambitious and optimistic. If he could see
                me somehow, he would despise what I have become.

                Ca

                But I have realized that our desires do not stay the same over
                time. I think it's easy to forget that we are not the same
                people we were 5 years ago; we are not even the same people we
                were a year ago. As we grow older and become more logical, the
                world just starts becoming less magical. (Or maybe all of this
                is just coping to console the 12-year-old me).

                People think that they will work hard in their 20s, make a lot
                of money, and then retire in their 30s and then pursue their
                passions, move into a calm place, and just chill for the rest of
                their lives. But when the time comes, even if they have made
                enough money, they realize that they don't want to do it now,
                maybe because they have grown past that desire and now they want
                to pursue something else, or they have some kind of
                responsibilities like family or their professional career.

                So, do what you want to do now because then you won't want to.
                It's okay to have wants that others don't understand.
